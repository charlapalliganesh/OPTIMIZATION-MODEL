# Optimization Model - Task 4

This project presents an *Optimization Model* developed in Python using the PuLP library for solving *Linear Programming (LP)* problems. The objective is to maximize profits for a business scenario involving the production of multiple products under constraints of resource availability.

---

##  Problem Statement

A company produces two products: *Product A* and *Product B*. The goal is to determine how many units of each product to produce in order to maximize profit, considering:
- *Objective:* Maximize profit
- *Constraints:* Limited availability of resources (Resource 1, Resource 2, and Resource 3)
- *Profit per Unit:* Different for each product

---

##  Approach

- *Linear Programming Formulation*
    - *Decision Variables:* Number of units for each product
    - *Objective Function:* Maximize total profit
    - *Constraints:* Resource limitations for production

- *Implementation Tools*
    - Python
    - PuLP library for defining and solving the LP problem
